This is my Fuel Tracking Desktop Application. 

The application allows users to enter, update, and securely store their fuel transaction data. Alongside this, it provides instant analysis of fuel usage through graphs, summaries, and calculations. Users can also download their data through a variety of filters to their local machine.

To run, simply download the AtlantisFuel.jar file from the Releases and open it on your local machine. 

A full performance and usage overview of this application is available here: [Atlantis Fuel](https://youtu.be/4qHro9PBJzo)
